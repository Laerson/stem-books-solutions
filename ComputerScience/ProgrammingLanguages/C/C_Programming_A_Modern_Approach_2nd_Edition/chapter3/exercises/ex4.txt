The string in the buffer is "10.3 5 6\n"
first it tries to match something to the %d, 1 is valid, followed by 0
'.' isn't valid for a %d, so it goes back to the buffer. The value 10 is stored in the variable i, and we have left in the buffer ".3 5 6\n"

now, the function tries to match something to the %f, it starts with the '.', followed by the 3, and finds a space. It stops, matches the value 0.3 to the variable x, and put the whitespace back.

the buffer now has the string " 5 6\n".
Now it tries to match it to the final %d, the whitespace is ignored, and it finds a 5, followed by a whitespace. The whitespace goes back to the buffer, and the value 5 is assigned to the variable j.

At the end we have:
i = 10
x = 0.3
j = 5

and the buffer has " 6\n".
